# Process
## movement
- After being given the rectangular base, we started sketching out where all the parts would go. we made sure to leave suffiecient space between all the different components.
- to attach the motors to the base, we drilled holes for the motor brackets. instead of 4, we found a way to only drill two holes diagonally so that the motor would not budge.
- we then attached the motor by again screwing bolts between the motor and bracket.
- we then soldered the wires connecting the motors to the arduino so that they would go all the way around.
- we ziptied the H bridge and placed the wheels on the motor by using bolts and metal hubs. we made sure to screw it very tightly so that any movement would be due to the code as opposed to a loosely attached wheel
## script and character
- after settling on the robo-love island concept for the play, we got to thinking on which character would bring the most interesting story to the table.
- we were adamant to have our robot be different in that it does not come from a wealthy or urban family, as to introduce some diversity into the cast.
- after running through a few ideas, we decided on 'Emma-Lou', a southern, country farm-helper robot who's a bit rough around the edges and hardworking.
- we agreed to pair her up with 'Magnus' who's on the complete opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to privelege and class. We thought this dynamic could introduce some interesting drama and thick tension to the play.
- the main parts we focused on when it came to the script was allowing her country side to shine, giving her some goofy lines that contrast heavily with the uptightness of Magnus.
- Words like "partner" and "Folks" keep her endearing to the audience, and the references to country slang such as "June bug" and "Bayou" add some spring to her dialogue. However, we still made sure to keep reminding the audience that shes a robot with references to "short circuiting" and being "programmed".
