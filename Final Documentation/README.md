# Process
## movement
- After being given the rectangular base, we started sketching out where all the parts would go. we made sure to leave suffiecient space between all the different components.
- to attach the motors to the base, we drilled holes for the motor brackets. instead of 4, we found a way to only drill two holes diagonally so that the motor would not budge.
- we then attached the motor by again screwing bolts between the motor and bracket.
- we then soldered the wires connecting the motors to the arduino so that they would go all the way around.
- we ziptied the H bridge and placed the wheels on the motor by using bolts and metal hubs. we made sure to screw it very tightly so that any movement would be due to the code as opposed to a loosely attached wheel
## script and character
- After settling on the robo-love island concept for the play, we got to thinking on which character would bring the most interesting story to the table.
- We were adamant to have our robot be different in that it does not come from a wealthy or urban family, as to introduce some diversity into the cast.
- after running through a few ideas, we decided on 'Emma-Lou', a southern, country farm-helper robot who's a bit rough around the edges and hardworking.
- We agreed to pair her up with 'Magnus' who's on the complete opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to privelege and class. We thought this dynamic could introduce some interesting drama and thick tension to the play.
- The main parts we focused on when it came to the script was allowing her country side to shine, giving her some goofy lines that contrast heavily with the uptightness of Magnus.
- Words like "partner" and "Folks" keep her endearing to the audience, and the references to country slang such as "June bug" and "Bayou" add some spring to her dialogue. However, we still made sure to keep reminding the audience that shes a robot with references to "short circuiting" and being "programmed".
## character design
- Building off of the country theme, we were inspired by the wizard of Oz to make our robot look like a scarecrow. After looking up several images of typical scarecrows, we came up with the design below:
- (insert image here)
- We felt like the design was feasible for the timeline we had to complete all the mechanics and aesthetics, as many of the outward components consisted of clothes we already had or could make, and costume props we could burrow from the costume or textile studio.
- From this design stemmed our overall plan in terms of the mechanics we were going to implement, and in which order.
#### creating the body
- At first, we felt the need to create a square body out of plywood with a long rectangular stick going through it for the arms, as to match the rectangular base we had (see image below). 
- (insert image here)
- However, we felt as though this did not stick true to our vision of the scarecrow and made it look way too boxy and large compared to the other robots. We also ran the risk of offsetting the balance of the base, which would have caused us a lot of trouble with movement and preventing it from tipping over.
- So instead, we decided to use two square sticks of wood in cross formation to mimick a real life scarecrow.
- To stabelize it, we used right angle steel parts and drilled screws to set them in place. We used three of these for the main body stick; one on each side and one on the back. We made sure it was stable before we moved on to the arms.
- For the arms, we used two screws in the middle to attach it to the main body, which ended up being really sturdy and did not need any further reinforcements.
- Then, we moved on to creating the crow. We wanted the crow to be lightweight and easy to manage or handle, since we had a strong feeling that we would need to pull it a part and have it sit on the arm which would be moving around a lot during the play. As such, we chose to use aluminum foil and light-weight clay.
- We first created the body so that we can test the durability and feasibility of our method. We first created a large ball out of the aluminum, and then slowly started flattening the bottom and lengthening the back to create a base and a tail. After we were satisfied with the shape, we began slowly building up layers of clay to cover over the aluminium. This proved to be a challenging task, as the clay would not stick to the aluminium and would instead slide around. To fix this, we used some water to make it stickier, which worked really well.
- After the body was done, we let it dry overnight and the result was just as we expected. The structure was light yet firm and retained the color and shape. So, we moved on to the head, which was made in two parts out of two hemispheres, and the beak, which was also in two parts. We wanted the head to be hollow and in two halfs so that we had more control over the internal mechanics and to allow for easy disassembling without damaging anything.
- When this was done, we were ready to move onto the main mechanics, which mainly involved the crow on the scarecrows neck, the neopixel eyes, and the scarecrow's head (as described in more detail below).
## mechanics
- Since our robot is supposed to represent a scarecrow, which in reality lacks much movement, we felt that it was appropriate to animate and bring the crow to life instead, serving as both a funny and entertaining gag for the audience, but also as an ironic friend to a scarecrow who is meant to scare off crows.
#### crow beak
- For the crows beak, we used a small servo motor and followed a youtube tutorial on how to create a mouth that opend and closes. We used a paper clip and bent it into an s shape, with one side attaching to the servo motor, and the other inside the upper part of the crow's beak. we kept having to adjust the opening of the head to allow for the crow's beak to move in a very asnimated way that would show clearly from afar for the audience.
