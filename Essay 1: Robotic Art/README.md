# Chico MacMurtrie and Amorphic Robot Works
<p>As robotic art emerges as a prominent genre in the todays scene, it challenges the conventional boundaries of expression, juxtaposing nature with the inorganic movement and functionality of robotic creations. Notably, Chico MacMurtrie and his collective, Amorphic Robot Works (ARW), have been pivotal in redefining this artistic landscape (“A brief lunch…” 2016; “Biography” n.d.).
Originating in the late 1980s, ARW established itself by crafting metal and robotic sculptures. Their innovative approach reached a turning point when they embarked on creating "soft machines," which were meant to act as a fusion between fluidity and organic forms. This was in stark contrast to the stereotypical rigid mechanics of robots (“A brief lunch…” 2016). This transition reflects the exceptional and innovative vision of MacMurtrie, who, drawing from the inherent geometry in living systems, was able to translate organic concepts into mechanical spectacles (“Biography” n.d.).</p>
<p>Diving into the essence, MacMurtrie's art transforms from seemingly dormant fabric structures to intricate moving wonders. This emphasizes the potential of robotics in art, pushing viewers to reconsider conventional definitions of transformation. Furthermore, MacMurtrie's inclination towards textile-like materials underlines a deliberate effort to challenge and redefine robotic aesthetics, begging the question of materiality and whether it has a place in artistic expression (“A brief lunch…” 2016).</p>
<p>Two works that, to me, vividly encapsulate MacMurtrie's work are "The Robotic Church" and "Border Crossers." "Border Crossers" provides a socio-political commentary. These lightweight, inflatable robotic sculptures are situated on the US-Mexican border. Transcending physical boundaries, they not only symbolize connection but also emphasize the potential of art to spark dialogue and challenge divisive constructs (“Chico Macmurtrie: Border Crossers” n.d.; “Border Crossers” n.d.). The soft-machines' gentle, organic movements starkly contrast with the rigid border fence, serving as a powerful metaphor for the peaceful, non-intimidating interconnectedness of border communities (ARW 2016).</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, "The Robotic Church" at first seemed to me like an erratic themed exhibition, scattering chaotic mechanics amidst a space. I found it hard to believe that it was produced by the same artist and art collective given its drastic contrast to “Border Crossers”. However, beneath the surface, it's an exploration into the realm of communication. Set in a historic church in Brooklyn, fifty pneumatic sculptures, named “robotic saints,” utilize their forms as instruments, evoking a machine-based language that is evocative of primal human communication (ARW 2014). Not only are the robots frantic in movement, but also in appearance. Perfectly encapsulating the opposite of his recent interest in fabric and soft machines, MacMurtrie very sparsely (if at all) covers the robotic bodies in transparent plastic, leaving every cord and chunk visible to the naked eye. This adds to the eeriness of the performance, and creates a drastic distinction between the historically rich church and the brassy, metallic clutter crowding both the space and the viewer's perception. Moreover, this stark contrast forces one to ponder the boundaries between the sacred and the irreligious. It challenges our preconceived notions of art within the confines of a once religious space and leaves audiences wondering whether this intersection is provocative, necessary, or merely akin to what we’re used to seeing in contemporary art today (“The Robotic Church” n.d.).</p>
<p>MacMurtrie's approach to robotic art is holistic, involving collaboration and coordination. While he envisions the concepts, the realization of his ideas is a collective effort, highlighting the significance of teamwork in the age of dramatic digital art. Moreover, the synergy between the collective’s diverse range of skills exemplifies the profound interdependence between art and technology. (“A brief lunch…” 2016).</p>
<p>As I contemplate the categorization of ARW's creations, MacMurtrie's suggestion that they are more accurately described as "machines" rather than robots due to their limited interaction with their surroundings (“A brief lunch…” 2016) adds complexity to the interpretation of robotic art. I had assumed prior that the terms were interchangeable, but MacMurtrie's hesitance suggests a deeper anthropomorphic significance to the term "robot". He appears to define it as an entity capable of directly affecting its surroundings. However, even when applying this definition, both of his previously mentioned works exhibit interactive qualities. "Border Crossers" transcends physical borders through movement, while the robots in "The Robotic Church" engage with surrounding instruments and their own bodies to create sound.</p>
<p>In essence, Chico MacMurtrie and ARW exemplify more than a merger of art and technology. Their work invites introspection on communication and societal constructs. As robotic art paves the way for the future, it becomes evident that its potential transcends mere entertainment and seeps into more meaningful dialogue.</p>
