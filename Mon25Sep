Robot short story:

The Shy Dancing Robot

What is dance? 
Whether it's stepping your feet or swaying back and forth with your body, dance can be virtually anything our bodies are capable of doing but what if you had to catch smooth rhythms with your rigid body. Our robot aims to showcase the possibility of emotion through rigid dance moves and happy turns. 
Our robot starts off very timid and shy, doubting its movements and capabilities and pausing every few steps to revise its next. As the robot catches on to the music, it starts to sway back and forth and braves into more turns. By the end of it, the robot conveys the emotions of excitement and happiness through its many twirls.
