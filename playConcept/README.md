## Title: "Right to Repair"

### Concept: 
In a future metropolis with humans and robots, the fate of R0-B3RT, a robot struck by a car, becomes a societal controversy. Surrounding his incident, six other robots with varying perspectives and backgrounds come together. 
Their unity and differences serve as a representation of robot society, compelling humans to reconsider notions of robot **healthcare rights**.

### Scene 1:
As R0-B3RT, a hard working robot who works as a ice-cream scooper at a local ice-cream vendor, lies damaged on the street after a hit-and-run, he's soon surrounded by six robots: 

- **A1-CE**: The elder, representing the first generation of robots.
- **N1-NA**: A nanny-bot who cares deeply for humans.
- **D0-KU**: A utility worker bot who believes in functionality over everything else.
- **M3-LA**: A robot celebrity and influencer.
- **S7-VN**: A security robot, strict and law-abiding.
- **T3-SS**: A young, idealistic robot advocating for robot rights.

They form a makeshift council, discussing the incident's implications and representing the diverse voices of robot society.

### Scene 2:
Taken to a Robot Care Unit, R0-B3RT's diagnosis becomes a focal point of debate among the seven. While A1-CE and N1-NA believe in traditional repairs, D0-KU and T3-SS argue for the right to advanced upgrades. M3-LA uses her influence to garner public sympathy, while S7-VN ensures that they follow legal protocols.

### Scene 3:
The courtroom, under the broadcast to the world, becomes a stage for these seven robots. Each robot is called as a witness, sharing their life stories and experiences, bringing to light the emotional and societal complexities of robot existence. Their testimonies, diverse and powerful, sway public opinion.

### Scene 4:
Post-verdict, the robots, (whether they won or lost the legal battle) come together at the accident site. They form a circle, joining hands, symbolizing unity and resilience. The scene closes with each robot expressing their aspiration for a future where robots are recognized not by their utility but by their shared sentience.

# Nouf's Idea
### Concept:
Robots straying away from their expected/programmed “norms” and given orders to “demand” individuality and the liberty to do their own thing. Showcasing how human biases and actions can always seep into everything we create shedding light on the creator and object relationship.

### Scene 1:
Robots being programmed by humans for a certain repetitive purpose. 

### Scene 2:
Robots start to reject some orders they are given and “lazy” out instead; copying humans and demanding time off or individuality.

### Scene 3:
Humans try to re-program robots to do their repetitive orders again and this time the robots reject every order fully. 

### Purpose: To bring into question that if something literally takes after you, isn't it bound to have the rights that you have too?
