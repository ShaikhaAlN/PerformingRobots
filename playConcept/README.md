# Title: "Right to Repair"

## Concept: 
In a future metropolis with humans and robots, the fate of R0-B3RT, a robot struck by a car, becomes a societal controversy. Surrounding his incident, six other robots with varying perspectives and backgrounds come together. 
Their unity and differences serve as a representation of robot society, compelling humans to reconsider notions of robot **healthcare rights**.

## Scene 1:
As R0-B3RT, a hard working robot who works as a ice-cream scooper at a local ice-cream vendor, lies damaged on the street after a hit-and-run, he's soon surrounded by six robots: 

- **A1-CE**: The elder, representing the first generation of robots.
- **N1-NA**: A nanny-bot who cares deeply for humans.
- **D0-KU**: A utility worker bot who believes in functionality over everything else.
- **M3-LA**: A robot celebrity and influencer.
- **S7-VN**: A security robot, strict and law-abiding.
- **T3-SS**: A young, idealistic robot advocating for robot rights.

They form a makeshift council, discussing the incident's implications and representing the diverse voices of robot society.

## Scene 2:
Taken to a Robot Care Unit, R0-B3RT's diagnosis becomes a focal point of debate among the seven. While A1-CE and N1-NA believe in traditional repairs, D0-KU and T3-SS argue for the right to advanced upgrades. M3-LA uses her influence to garner public sympathy, while S7-VN ensures that they follow legal protocols.

## Scene 3:
The courtroom, under the broadcast to the world, becomes a stage for these seven robots. Each robot is called as a witness, sharing their life stories and experiences, bringing to light the emotional and societal complexities of robot existence. Their testimonies, diverse and powerful, sway public opinion.

## Scene 4:
Post-verdict, the robots, (whether they won or lost the legal battle) come together at the accident site. They form a circle, joining hands, symbolizing unity and resilience. The scene closes with each robot expressing their aspiration for a future where robots are recognized not by their utility but by their shared sentience.
